# 🍬 Sweet Shop Management System (TDD Kata)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Sweet Shop Management System** developed as a **Test-Driven Development (TDD) Kata**. The objective of this project is to design, build, and test a full-stack application using modern development practices, clean architecture, and transparent AI-assisted development.

The system allows users to **register, log in, view sweets, search/filter them, and purchase sweets**, while **admin users** can manage inventory by adding, updating, restocking, or deleting sweets.

This project demonstrates my understanding of:

* RESTful API design
* Authentication & authorization
* Database integration
* Frontend–backend integration
* Test-Driven Development (TDD)
* Clean coding practices
* Responsible AI usage in software development

## 🧩 Features

### 👤 User Features

* User registration and login
* JWT-based authentication
* View all available sweets
* Search sweets by name, category, or price range
* Purchase sweets (disabled if out of stock)

### 👑 Admin Features

* Add new sweets
* Update sweet details
* Delete sweets
* Restock sweets

### 🍭 Sweet Attributes

Each sweet contains:

* Unique ID
* Name
* Category
* Price
* Quantity in stock

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Backend

* **Technology:** (Example: Node.js with TypeScript & Express)
* **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB / SQLite (Persistent DB used)
* **Testing:** Jest / Supertest (TDD approach)

### Frontend

* **Framework:** React (Single Page Application)
* **Styling:** CSS / Tailwind / Bootstrap
* **API Communication:** Axios / Fetch API

## 🔐 API Endpoints

### Authentication

```
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
```

### Sweets (Protected)

```
POST   /api/sweets
GET    /api/sweets
GET    /api/sweets/search
PUT    /api/sweets/:id
DELETE /api/sweets/:id   (Admin only)
```

### Inventory Management (Protected)

```
POST /api/sweets/:id/purchase
POST /api/sweets/:id/restock   (Admin only)
```

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

This project strictly follows the **Red → Green → Refactor** TDD cycle:

1. **Red:** Write failing tests first
2. **Green:** Implement minimum code to pass tests
3. **Refactor:** Improve code quality without breaking tests

### Test Coverage Includes:

* Authentication logic
* Authorization checks (Admin vs User)
* Sweet CRUD operations
* Inventory updates (purchase & restock)
* Edge cases (out of stock, invalid inputs, unauthorized access)

A detailed test report is included with the project.

## 🤖 My AI Usage

### AI Tools Used

* **ChatGPT**
* **GitHub Copilot** (optional)

### How I Used AI

* Used ChatGPT to **brainstorm API structure and endpoint naming**
* Generated **initial boilerplate code** for controllers and services
* Assisted in **writing unit and integration tests** following TDD
* Helped debug test failures and improve code readability
* Used AI suggestions selectively and manually refined logic

### Reflection on AI Usage

AI significantly improved my productivity by reducing setup time and helping me focus on problem-solving rather than boilerplate. However, I ensured:

* Full understanding of every line of generated code
* Manual validation and refactoring of AI-generated content
* Transparent acknowledgment of AI assistance in commits

AI was used as a **co-pilot, not a replacement for thinking**.

---

## 🧾 AI Co-Authorship in Commits

For every commit where AI assistance was used, I added the AI as a co-author:

```
Co-authored-by: ChatGPT <AI@users.noreply.github.com>
```

Each commit message clearly explains **what was generated by AI** and **what was manually implemented**.

---

## 📂 Git & Version Control

* Frequent, descriptive commits
* Clear development narrative
* Proper branching strategy

---

## 🚀 Deployment 

The application can be deployed using:

* **Frontend:** Vercel / Netlify
* **Backend:** Render / Heroku / AWS
* **Database:** Managed cloud database

> Live deployment link (if available) will be added here.

## ✅ Conclusion

This project reflects my ability to:

* Build scalable full-stack applications
* Apply Test-Driven Development effectively
* Write clean and maintainable code
* Use AI responsibly and transparently

Thank you for reviewing my project 🙌
